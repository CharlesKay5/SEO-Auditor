## Introduction
SEO Auditor is a program that I built using Svelte to audit websites for potential SEO issues. I built this program for a previous employer, who unfortunately has since become defunct and never ended up using it. The purpose of this program was to generate a sample audit for potential clients, in the hopes that they would hire the company to fix their SEO issues.

## Features
- **Generate an Audit:** Enter a website's URL in the provided field and watch an audit generate based on the SEO of that site.
- **Save Audit as a PDF:** Press Ctrl+P and select Save as PDF to download a PDF version of your audit. 

## Technologies Used
1. **Frontend:** Svelte JavaScript compiler for client-side rendering + HTML, CSS, JavaScript
2. **Backend:** Node.js, Express.js for server side
3. **Web Scraping:** Puppeteer
4. **SEO Metrics:** Puppeteer/Lighthouse

## Usage
To use the program, simply install it from this repository, and use the command "npm start". The server should run on port 9778, so just visit [localhost:9778](http://localhost:9778) to use it!
